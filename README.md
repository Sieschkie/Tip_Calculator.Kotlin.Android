# Tip Calculator

## Overview
<p>Tipping is a way to show your satisfaction and your gratitude for the service you get. However, it's a pain in the neck to calculate the amount of tip, so i had to createÂ a handy tool that will make it easier!</p><br/><br/>

This is a simple Android application that calculates the tip amount based on the bill amount and tip percentage. The app uses `EditText` for user input, a `SeekBar` for selecting the tip percentage, and `TextView`s to display the calculated bill value and tip amount. The tip amount is updated dynamically as the user inputs the bill amount or changes the tip percentage.

## Features
- **Bill Amount Input:** Users can enter the total bill amount.
- **Tip Percentage Selection:** A SeekBar allows users to select the tip percentage.
- **Real-Time Calculation:** The tip amount and total amount are updated in real-time as users input the bill amount and adjust the tip percentage.
- **Validation:** Input validation to handle invalid bill amounts.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Android Development:** Creating a user interface with XML and managing activities with Kotlin.
- **Event Handling:** Implementing `TextWatcher` for EditText and `SeekBar.OnSeekBarChangeListener` for SeekBar to handle user input events.
- **Data Handling:** Using `BigDecimal` for accurate financial calculations and ensuring proper input validation.
- **UI Design:** Designing a user-friendly interface with proper layout constraints and visibility management.
